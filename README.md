# bot_factory_simulation
Imagine that you have a factory where you have the bots, which works with some equipment 

Some bots have bigger priority than others 

When bot get some equipment he start rebalance equipment, it means that he send one 
equipment to some bot and other to another bot  

For start factory you need add input.txt with initial data to project root, you already have one
